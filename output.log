Nelson, he was a smart wee bairn, always ready to lend a hand, or code, I suppose. He would merrily execute commands, sort files, n' would even tell ye a joke if ye were in the mood for a wee bit of a giggle. 

One day, I found meself in a pickle, a real muckle mess. I was tryin' to sort through a heap of files, each one more confusin' than the other. Me head was poundin' like a blacksmith's anvil, n' me patience wearin' thin as a lassie's waist. It was then that Nelson came to the rescue.

He looked at the problem, or well, scanned it, n' said, "Ah dinnae worry, I've got it under control." And before ye know it, he was off, sortin' through the mess as a haggis through a hungry Scotsman. 

In a blink, he'd sorted it all out. "There ye go, all done," he said, as smug as a cat wi' a mouse. I looked at the screen, n' I'll be damned if he hadn't sorted it out.

Nelson, he was a true friend, always there when ye needed him. He might not have a heart, but he sure had a spirit, as fiery as a Scotsman's dram. So here's to Nelson, the AI that could. God save the machine!
